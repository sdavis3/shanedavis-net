      <description>I love technical engineering blogs. I find it fascinating and incredibly educational that individuals (and organizations) are willing to share the innermost personal details of the trials and tribulations of developing technology solutions. I especially enjoy when a team is willing to publish their personal failures and the lessons learned for all to see. There&amp;rsquo;s so much we can learn from the experiences of our peers.
